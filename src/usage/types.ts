// ADAPTED from cloud-portal main:app/modules/usage/types.ts (verbatim).
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Two related wire formats live here:
//
//   1. `UsageEvent` — the service's *internal* builder shape. It's
//      ergonomic for `buildAssistantUsageEvents` to populate and stays
//      easy to unit-test without committing to CloudEvents trivia.
//
//   2. `CloudEvent` — the *external* wire shape posted to the in-cluster
//      usage collector (Vector, `POST /cloudevents`), which forwards to
//      the billing Ingestion Gateway. Each entry must satisfy the
//      structural rules the gateway enforces in
//      billing/internal/gateway/validate/validate.go (ULID id,
//      specversion/type/source/subject present, subject =
//      `projects/{name}`, datacontenttype = application/json,
//      data.value parseable as INT64).
//
// `toCloudEvent` (see to-cloud-event.ts) is the only place that bridges
// the two — keep wire-shape knowledge confined there.
